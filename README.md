# Artificial-Intelligence-Using-Java
Here, in this project, I step by step did algorithms related to artificial intelligence such as Graphs algorithms, meta-heuristic optimization methods (such as genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, simulated annealing, Travelling Salesman Problem), search optimization algorithms. And then about the most famous algorithm for gaming related to Artificial Algorithm such as minimax algorithm and at last I built a Tic-Tac-Toe game using minimax algorithm.
